## Overview

This project addresses the time-consuming and error-prone process of manual timetable creation in educational institutions. The system automatically generates conflict-free timetables while respecting constraints such as:

- Teacher availability and workload
- Room capacity and availability
- Lab sessions requiring consecutive periods
- Break times (short breaks and lunch breaks)
- Subject duration (single or double periods)
- Batch-specific classes for practical sessions

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Intelligent Timetable Generation**: Automatically creates weekly schedules using constraint-based algorithms
- **Conflict Detection & Prevention**: Ensures no teacher/room double-booking
- **Batch Management**: Supports dividing classes into batches for lab sessions
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Handles both single-period lectures and double-period labs
- **Break Integration**: Automatically schedules short breaks and lunch breaks
- **Real-time Editing**: Modify generated timetables with instant validation
- **PDF Export**: Download timetables in PDF format

### Role-Based Access
- **Admin Dashboard**: Full CRUD operations on classes, subjects, teachers, rooms, and timetables
- **Teacher Portal**: Personalized timetable view with all assigned classes
- **Student Portal**: Class-specific timetable view

### Data Management
- **Persistent Storage**: Save multiple timetable versions with timestamps
- **Historical Records**: View previously generated timetables
- **Bulk Operations**: Manage multiple subjects/batches simultaneously
- **Teacher-Subject Mapping**: Assign multiple subjects to teachers in one go

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)
- Bootstrap 5
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Custom CSS

**Backend:**

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MySQL (v8 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/timetable-generator.git
cd timetable-generator
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure database connection**
Update database credentials in `app.js`:
```javascript
const connection = mysql.createConnection({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'your_username',
    password: 'your_password',
    database: 'timetable_db'
});
```

4. **Set up the database**

5. **Start the server**
```bash
node app.js
```

6. **Access the application**
Open your browser and navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## Database Setup

### Key Tables

**Users & Authentication:**
- `users` - Stores user credentials and roles
- `roles` - Defines user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student)

**Academic Structure:**
- `classes` - Class information (CS SY-A, CS TY-B, etc.)
- `batches` - Batch divisions within classes
- `subjects` - Subject details with duration and allocations
- `teachers` - Teacher information
- `rooms` - Available rooms/labs

**Scheduling:**
- `period_timings` - Period start/end times and breaks
- `saved_timetables` - Generated timetable storage
- `teacher_timetables` - Teacher-specific schedules
- `teacher_subjects` - Many-to-many relationship between teachers and subjects

### Sample Data Insertion

```sql
-- Create a class
INSERT INTO classes (class_name) VALUES ('CS SY-A');

-- Add batches
INSERT INTO batches (batch_id, class_id, batch_name) 
VALUES ('1_A1', 1, 'Batch A1');

-- Add subject
INSERT INTO subjects (subject_name, max_allocations, class_id, duration, batch_id) 
VALUES ('JAVA LAB', 5, 1, 2, '1_A1');

-- Add teacher
INSERT INTO teachers (teacher_name) VALUES ('Prof. John Doe');
```
